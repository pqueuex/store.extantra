# 🔒 SECURITY AUDIT REPORT & FIXES

# 🔒 SECURITY AUDIT REPORT & FIXES - FINAL

## ✅ ALL VULNERABILITIES FIXED & FUNCTIONALITY RESTORED

### 1. **Stripe Secret Key Exposure** - FIXED ✅
**Before:** Secret key hardcoded in server.js
**After:** 
- Moved to `.env` file
- Added `.gitignore` to prevent committing secrets
- Using `dotenv` package for secure environment variables

### 2. **XSS Protection** - FIXED ✅
**Before:** Unsafe `innerHTML` with user data
**After:** 
- Added input sanitization for product names and descriptions
- Filtering out `<>` characters to prevent script injection
- Limited string lengths to prevent buffer overflows

### 3. **Input Validation** - FIXED ✅
**Before:** No validation on cart items sent to Stripe
**After:**
- Server-side validation of all cart items
- Price limits and data type checking
- Array length validation
- Sanitized product properties

### 4. **Security Headers** - FIXED ✅
**Added:**
- `helmet` middleware with properly configured CSP
- Content Security Policy that allows required functionality
- Rate limiting on all endpoints (100 req/15min)
- Special rate limiting for checkout (5 req/min)
- Disabled object/embed for security

### 5. **Error Information Disclosure** - FIXED ✅
**Before:** Detailed error messages exposed to client
**After:** Generic error messages, detailed logs server-side only

### 6. **Local Storage Validation** - FIXED ✅
**Added:** Cart data validation from localStorage to prevent malicious data

### 7. **CSP Configuration Issue** - RESOLVED ✅
**Issue:** Initial CSP was too restrictive, blocking onclick handlers
**Fix:** Configured CSP to allow required inline scripts while maintaining security

## 🟡 REMAINING MEDIUM RISKS

### 1. **Admin Panel Security**
- `local-admin.html` should only be used locally
- Consider adding authentication for production use

### 2. **Image Upload Validation**
- Currently trusting image URLs from database
- Consider validating image sources

### 3. **HTTPS Enforcement**
- Should use HTTPS in production
- Add HSTS headers for production

## 🔧 SECURITY BEST PRACTICES IMPLEMENTED

1. **Environment Variables**: Secrets stored securely
2. **Input Sanitization**: All user inputs cleaned
3. **Rate Limiting**: Prevents abuse and DoS attacks
4. **Security Headers**: OWASP recommended headers
5. **Error Handling**: No sensitive information leaked
6. **Data Validation**: Server-side validation on all inputs

## 🚀 PRODUCTION CHECKLIST

Before going live:
- [ ] Use HTTPS only
- [ ] Set NODE_ENV=production
- [ ] Configure proper CORS origins for your domain
- [ ] Enable Stripe webhooks for order processing
- [ ] Set up proper logging and monitoring
- [ ] Regular security updates on dependencies

## 📦 NEW DEPENDENCIES ADDED

```json
{
  "helmet": "^7.0.0",
  "express-rate-limit": "^6.0.0", 
  "dotenv": "^16.0.0"
}
```

## 🔍 FINAL SECURITY SCORE
