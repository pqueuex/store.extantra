## Final Thoughts

This roadmap is aggressive but achievable. You have:
- ✅ Unique asset (3D models = content moat)
- ✅ Proven product (42% margins)
- ✅ Time to execute (no full-time job)
- ✅ Low burn rate (student lifestyle)

**The difference between $500/month and $2,000/month is execution.** Post every day, track every metric, ship every order on time.

**Most people quit at Week 3-4 when they don't see immediate viral success.** Push through. Your 30th video might be the one that hits 500k views and changes everything.

**Let's build this. 🔥**
