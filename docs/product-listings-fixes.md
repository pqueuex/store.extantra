# ðŸ”§ Product Listings Page Fixes

## Issues Fixed

### 1. âœ… Only 1 Product Per Page
**Problem:** Grid was showing only 2 columns, making it look sparse  
**Fix:** Changed from `repeat(2, 1fr)` to `repeat(3, 1fr)`  
**Result:** Now shows 3 products per row (fits nicely in 480px container)

---

### 2. âœ… Images Not Square
**Problem:** Images had fixed `height: 200px` which wasn't square  
**Fix:** Changed to `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` (modern CSS property)  
**Result:** All product images are now perfect squares that scale responsively

---

### 3. âœ… Sorting/Filter Bar Too Big on Mobile
**Problem:** Our mobile fix made ALL inputs 16px (including filters)  
**Fix:** Made the 16px rule specific only to form inputs (engraving, zip code)  
**Result:** Filter controls stay small (10px) while form inputs are 16px for iOS

---

### 4. âœ… Duplicate CSS Rule
**Problem:** Found duplicate `.product-grid` definition at line ~2870 overriding our layout  
**Fix:** Removed the duplicate rule  
**Result:** Clean CSS with single source of truth for product grid

## Changes Made to `styles.css`

### Product Grid Layout
```css
/* Before */
.product-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(2, 1fr);
}

/* After */
.product-grid {
    grid-template-columns: repeat(3, 1fr);
}
```

### Product Images (Square)
```css
/* Before */
.product-image {
    height: 200px;
}

/* After */
.product-image {
    aspect-ratio: 1 / 1;  /* Perfect square */
}
```

### Mobile Input Sizing (Selective)
```css
/* Before - affected ALL inputs */
input, textarea, select {
    font-size: 16px !important;
}

/* After - only form inputs */
.engraving-input input,
.engraving-input textarea,
#zip-code-input {
    font-size: 16px !important;
}

/* Keep filter controls small */
.filter-group select,
.filter-group label,
.filter-controls {
    font-size: 10px !important;
}
```

---

## Result

### Desktop View (480px+)
- 3 products per row
- Square product images
- Small, compact filter bar

### Mobile View (<480px)
- Still 3 products per row (scales down nicely)
- Square product images (responsive)
- Small filter bar (doesn't take up space)
- Form inputs are 16px (no iOS zoom)

---

## Visual Breakdown

**Before:**
```
[Product 1] [Product 2]
            
[Product 3] [Product 4]
```
Only 2 per row, lots of white space

**After:**
```
[Product 1] [Product 2] [Product 3]
[Product 4] [Product 5] [Product 6]
```
3 per row, better use of space

---

## Testing

Open `lighters.html` and verify:
- âœ… 3 products show per row
- âœ… Product images are perfect squares
- âœ… Filter dropdowns are small and compact
- âœ… On mobile, everything still looks good
- âœ… Forms still have 16px inputs (no iOS zoom)

---

## Notes

- `aspect-ratio: 1 / 1` is modern CSS (works in all current browsers)
- 3 columns fits perfectly in 480px width (3 Ã— ~140px + gaps)
- Filter controls won't trigger iOS zoom because they're < 16px (but that's okay - they're dropdowns, not text inputs)
- Form text inputs stay 16px to prevent iOS Safari auto-zoom behavior

All fixed! ðŸŽ‰
